This is a little Ruby / Sinatra web-based voting app for the Academy Awards.

Users enter a name, then guess what is going to win in each category. At the end, they are scored on how accurate they were.

nominees.yaml contains the nominees for each category.

To enter the correct answers, vote normally with the name 'Correct".
